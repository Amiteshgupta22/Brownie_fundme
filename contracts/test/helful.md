1. If we want brownie to remember netwrok which are in development then we can add it .
2. Ganche cli is a development netwrok in vscode and Ganche local is etherium netwrok
3. we can add it in etherium netwrok as it is persistant.
if I add account through terminal then it is added in brownie not acces through accouts[0], 
account = account.load()
Note: Im using my metamask account on the local blockchain, ad I hace added private key to config.
If Im using the real network not in development or ganache local -> config 
If I'm using the metamask account on goerli chain , then it should have gorli in wallet.
If I'm using it on mainnet-forked then I need to add mainnet forked coin in wallet

There is no relation of account and testnet

4. Price fedd is a type of aggregatorv3itnergace contract so its address s needed to access it and aggregatorv3itnerface is type of array and if we put its adress into it then we will get the contract.
